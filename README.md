This code is our solution for the [8th WOSDETC Drone-vs-Bird Detection Challenge](https://wosdetc2025.wordpress.com/), hosted at IJCNN 2025. Specifically, this repository provides the code to create our proposed WRN-YOLO and the synthetic dataset used in our submission. Our approach ranked Top 3 globally in the challenge! üèÖüéâü•≥

## Setup environment
```bash
pip install ultralytics==8.3.71
pip install grad-cam==1.5.4
```

## Dataset
The dataset was provided by the [WOSDETC](https://github.com/wosdetc/challenge) Drone-vs-Bird Detection Challenge [@IJCNN2025](https://2025.ijcnn.org/) committee. To aquire the dataset you may follow the instructions [here](https://wosdetc2025.wordpress.com/instruction-for-authors/). You will be asked to sign a data usage agreement and can then use the data for research purposes.  

Meanwhile, you can also download our synthetic dataset in [roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/project-psbzx/synthetic-fenky).

## Acknowledgement

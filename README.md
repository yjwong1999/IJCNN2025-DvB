This code is our solution for the [8th WOSDETC Drone-vs-Bird Detection Challenge](https://wosdetc2025.wordpress.com/), hosted at IJCNN 2025. Specifically, this repository provides the code to create our proposed WRN-YOLO and the synthetic dataset used in our submission. Our approach ranked 3rd globally in the challenge! 🏅🎉🥳
